                    Company as part of the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
                    Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of
                    role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred as the "core series" by their developers

                            the three starter Pokémon. This creates a simple triangle to explain the type concept easily
                            to new players. Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a
                            wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                            the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

                    and December.

                decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its

                            <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic
                                knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed
                                in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger
                                evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped
                                into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers
                                should be able to answer.</li>

                            <li> Not all  Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off
                                with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the
                                stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any
                                Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective
                                Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is
